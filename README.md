# data_1_checks

##This project takes Weather Data from www.visualcrossing.com. The CSV I choose included weather data for Louisville, Kentucky. From July 12th, 2020 to July 12th, 2022.
##It inlucdes all types of info including the date, the condiotons of the day, the temperature, the cloud coverage, and much more.
##My project has multiple visualizations including one that shows the max temperature of the day and how it correlates with the cloud coverage for the day.


#REQUIREMENTS\

#Completed
## 1. I use a command to take my dataframe and put it into a dictionary that includes an entire page of key value pairs\
## 2. For data cleaning I displayed all of my dataframs columns so I could drop the columns that weren't useful to me. I then renamed the remaining columns to fit my preferences\
## 3. I created a definition that averaged the sum of both the Max Temperature and Min Temperature. If you were to call the definitions they would also be printed\
## 4. I made a linechart and scatter plot to visualize my data\
## 5. I wrote markdowns through comments on the less obvious code to explain what was happening 

#Notes\
##my project runs best on jupyter notebook since that is where it was created
